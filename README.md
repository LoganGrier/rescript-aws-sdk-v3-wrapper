# ReScript AWS SDK v3 bindings

A set of bindings for the AWS JavaScript SDK v3 for use with ReScript.

**These are an unofficial set of ReScript bindings - they are not officially provided by or endorsed by AWS.**

The bindings are still experimental as a number of outstanding issues with generation
need to be resolved (see the [TODO](TODO.md) for more details).
