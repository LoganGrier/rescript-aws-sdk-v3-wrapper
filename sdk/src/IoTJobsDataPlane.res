         set of devices to download and install application or firmware updates, reboot, rotate certificates, or perform
         remote troubleshooting operations.</p>
         <p> To create a job, you make a job document which is a description of the remote operations to be
         performed, and you specify a list of targets that should perform the operations. The targets can be individual
         things, thing groups or both.</p>
         <p> AWS IoT Jobs sends a message to inform the targets that a job is available. The target starts the
         execution of the job by downloading the job document, performing the operations it specifies, and reporting its
         progress to AWS IoT. The Jobs service provides commands to track the progress of a job on a specific target and
         for all the targets of the job</p>")
