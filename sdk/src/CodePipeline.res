            <b>Overview</b>
        </p>
        <p>This is the AWS CodePipeline API Reference. This guide provides descriptions of the
            actions and data types for AWS CodePipeline. Some functionality for your pipeline can
            only be configured through the API. For more information, see the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/welcome.html\">AWS
                CodePipeline User Guide</a>.</p>
        <p>You can use the AWS CodePipeline API to work with pipelines, stages, actions, and
            transitions.</p>
        <p>
            <i>Pipelines</i> are models of automated release processes. Each pipeline
            is uniquely named, and consists of stages, actions, and transitions. </p>
        <p>You can work with pipelines by calling:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <a>CreatePipeline</a>, which creates a uniquely named

            <li>
                <p>
                    <a>DeletePipeline</a>, which deletes the specified

            <li>
                <p>
                    <a>GetPipeline</a>, which returns information about the pipeline

                <p>
                    <a>UpdatePipeline</a>, which updates a pipeline with edits or changes
                    to the structure of the pipeline.</p>
            </li>
         </ul>
        <p>Pipelines include <i>stages</i>. Each stage contains one or more
            actions that must complete before the next stage begins. A stage results in success or
            failure. If a stage fails, the pipeline stops at that stage and remains stopped until
            either a new version of an artifact appears in the source location, or a user takes
            action to rerun the most recent artifact through the pipeline. You can call <a>GetPipelineState</a>, which displays the status of a pipeline, including the
            status of stages in the pipeline, or <a>GetPipeline</a>, which returns the
            entire structure of the pipeline, including the stages of that pipeline. For more
            information about the structure of stages and actions, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/pipeline-structure.html\">AWS CodePipeline
                Pipeline Structure Reference</a>.</p>
        <p>Pipeline stages include <i>actions</i> that are categorized into
            categories such as source or build actions performed in a stage of a pipeline. For
            example, you can use a source action to import artifacts into a pipeline from a source
            such as Amazon S3. Like stages, you do not work with actions directly in most cases, but
            you do define and interact with actions when working with pipeline operations such as
                <a>CreatePipeline</a> and <a>GetPipelineState</a>. Valid
            action categories are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Source</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Build</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Test</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Deploy</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Approval</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Invoke</p>
            </li>
         </ul>
        <p>Pipelines also include <i>transitions</i>, which allow the transition
            of artifacts from one stage to the next in a pipeline after the actions in one stage
            complete.</p>
        <p>You can work with transitions by calling:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <a>DisableStageTransition</a>, which prevents artifacts from
                    transitioning to the next stage in a pipeline.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <a>EnableStageTransition</a>, which enables transition of artifacts
                    between stages in a pipeline. </p>
            </li>
         </ul>

            <b>Using the API to integrate with AWS CodePipeline</b>
        </p>
        <p>For third-party integrators or developers who want to create their own integrations
            with AWS CodePipeline, the expected sequence varies from the standard API user. To
            integrate with AWS CodePipeline, developers need to work with the following
            items:</p>
        <p>
            <b>Jobs</b>, which are instances of an action. For
            example, a job for a source action might import a revision of an artifact from a source. </p>
        <p>You can work with jobs by calling:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <a>AcknowledgeJob</a>, which confirms whether a job worker has
                    received the specified job.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <a>GetJobDetails</a>, which returns the details of a job.</p>

            <li>
                <p>
                    <a>PollForJobs</a>, which determines whether there are any jobs to
                    act on.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <a>PutJobFailureResult</a>, which provides details of a job failure.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <a>PutJobSuccessResult</a>, which provides details of a job

         </ul>
        <p>
            <b>Third party jobs</b>, which are instances of an action
            created by a partner action and integrated into AWS CodePipeline. Partner actions are
            created by members of the AWS Partner Network.</p>
        <p>You can work with third party jobs by calling:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <a>AcknowledgeThirdPartyJob</a>, which confirms whether a job worker
                    has received the specified job.</p>

                <p>
                    <a>GetThirdPartyJobDetails</a>, which requests the details of a job
